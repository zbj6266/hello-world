Hello World
Hi Everyone, my name is Baijun Zhu just graduated from UC Davis on March 2019.
I had an internship in a mapping company called DeepMap and I am there as an Full Stack Engineer. I did a lot of proejcts such as migrating a lot of APIs from one repo to another one, developing serval APIs in backend by using Java and use these APIs to create Front-end search detail pages and also imporve UI design by using ReactJS and also I set up an localHost to test with the APIs functionalities I implemented by using goLang. I am a fast learner and have a great passion to learn new knowledge. I am also well familiar with data structures and algorithmn.
